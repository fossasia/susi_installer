# Installation of SUSI.AI Personal Assistant

This repository provides installation script for SUSI.AI for Linux Desktops
as well as for our development SUSI.AI Smart Speaker based on Raspberry Pi.

## Quickstart

If you want to get SUSI.AI Personal Assistant installed quickly without reading
all the small print, here is a quickstart.

### Preferred method: user install with `sudo`

The preferred method is installing SUSI.AI into your home directory, but using
`sudo` to install the required Python modules. If this is an option for you,
first do
```
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossasia/susi_installer/development/install-requirements.sh
  bash install-requirements.sh --system-install
```
followed by
```
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossasia/susi_installer/development/install.sh
  bash install.sh
```
(this will change to `install.sh` after testing).

This will install all necessary system packages and Python libraries, and
SUSI.AI into `~/SUSI.AI`.

### Another method: user install without `sudo`

This method is much less tested, because the required Python modules will
be installed into your home directory (`~/.local/lib`). On the other hand,
no `sudo` permissions are needed, and everything can be done as local user:
```
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossasia/susi_installer/development/install-requirements.sh
  bash install-requirements.sh --sudo-cmd ""
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossasia/susi_installer/development/install.sh
  bash install.sh
```

### The rest

All other methods require root permissions and we recommend reading the
full document before trying them.


### Running SUSI.AI after installation

The installation procedure gives indication how to use `systemctl` command to
start the SUSI.AI server and personal assistant, but if your desktop
environment supports `.desktop` files, then the following items should be
available in your desktop environment menu:

- **SUSI Server**
- **SUSI.AI Personal Assistant** - starts the privacy assistant in the background
- **SUSI.AI Personal Assistant - Application Window** - an application that
  allows interaction via an GUI
- **SUSI.AI Personal Assistant - Configuration** - configuration of various
  parameters of SUSI.AI

More programs and services will be added over time.


## Prerequisites

The installation script expects certain programs and libraries being installed
on the system, in particular the following programs need to be available
(not necessarily for the installation, but also for operation of SUSI.AI
programs afterwards). The following table lists the required programs and
the respective packages in Debian/Buster and Fedora 31:

| Program | Debian/Ubuntu/Mint   | Fedora 31   | OpenSuSE Leap 15.1 |
| ------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| git     | git                  | git         | git |
| wget    | wget                 | wget        | wget |
| sox     | sox                  | sox (1)     | sox |
| java    | default-jre-headless | java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless | java-1_8_0-openjdk-headless |
| vlc     | vlc-bin              | vlc (2)     | vlc |
| flac    | flac                 | flac        | flac |
| python3 | python3              | python3     | python3 |
| pip3    | python3-pip          | python3-pip | python3-pip |
| - (3)   | python3-setuptools   | python3-setuptools | python3-setuptools |
| - (4)   | libatlas3-base       | blas        | libopenblas_pthreads0 |


(1) `sox` is not available in CentOS 8, this will probably make some of the
functionality break.

(2) On Fedora and CentOS, VLC is not available by default and the RPMFusion
repository needs to be enabled. The procedure is described
[here](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/setup_rpmfusion/).
If the `--system-install` command line option is used with
`install-requirements.sh`, this will be done automatically.

(3) `python3-setuptools` doesn't provide a binary, but it is required to be
installed, otherwise installations of other packages using `pip3` will
not work.

(4) Some package providing `libcblas` is necessary.

The above packages (plus two packages, see below under (\*)) can be optionally
installed by `install-requirements.sh` by adding the command line option
`--system-install`. Other options are installation on Debian using
`sudo apt-get install PKGS`, on Fedora `sudo dnf install PKGS`, on openSUSE
`sudo zypper install PKGS` (but read the note (1) and (2) above!).

Furthermore, a considerable list of Python libraries are required for full
operation. The script `install-requirements` will install them using `pip3`
if they are not already installed. That means, at installation time one
can decide to either use the distribution (Debian, Fedora,...) provided
packages or those directly available from the PyPy distribution.

To ensure that additional repositories can be used, `pip3` needs to be
at least at version 19 to ensure we can specify additional repositories
in the requirement files. The `install-requirements` script will update
`pip3` if this requirement is not fulfilled.

### List of Python packages

In the following we give the list of Python packages that are required
as of 12/2019. The definitive list is obtained from the `requirements.txt`
files in the repositories of `susi_installer`, `susi_python`, and `susi_linux`.

We provide PIP package names and Debian package names if available, and will
try to provide updated lists for other distributions, too.

| PIP | Debian/Buster | Ubuntu 18.04/Mint 19.2 |Fedora 31 | openSuSE Leap 15.1 |

| async_promises	| -		     | - | - | - |
| geocoder		| -		     | - | - | - |
| soundcloud-lib	| -		     | - | - | - |

(\*) The packages `pyaudio` and `python-Levenshtein` **should** be installed
via the system manager due to their dependencies on external libraries,
in particular `libportaudio`. If `--system-install` is passed to
`install-requirements.sh`, these two packages will be installed, too.

Packages that are only required for installation on the Raspbian based
SUSI.AI smart speaker:

| PIP      | Debian/Buster | Fedora |
| -------- | --- | --- |
| spidev   | -   | python3-spidev |
| RPi.GPIO | -   | - |


Installation of some of these packages requires adding an extra repository
for `pip3` using `--extra-index-url https://repo.fury.io/fossasia/`.
This is done automatically by the `install-requirements` script.


### Installation of requirements

The provided script `install-requirements` checks that the above mentioned
programs are available, checks the version number of the available `pip3`
binary, updating it if necessary using `pip3` itself, and then uses `pip3`
to install the missing requirements.

The script uses `sudo` to obtain `root` rights to install the necessary Python
libraries.


## Installation of SUSI.AI

The installaction script `install.sh` carries out the actual installation
on the target system. It checks that the above set of programs is availabe,
clones the necessary git repositories from github, and installs Systemd
unit files to allow starting/enabling the respective programs. On the
Raspberry based SUSI.AI Smart Speaker, several further tasks are carried
out to set up audio playback, sound device setup etc.

### Installation modes

The installation can be carried out in either `user` moder or `system`
mode:

- `user mode`: All files are installed into the directory `SUSI.AI`
  in the home directory of the current user (the location can be configured).
  Systemd unit files into the current user's systemd configuration directory.
  Utility programs for SUSI.AI are installed into `SUSI.AI/bin`.

- `system mode`: All files are installed into the directory `SUSI.AI` in
  `/usr/local` (again, the location can be configured), and systemd unit
  files are installed in the system-wide systemd configuration directories.
  Utility programs for SUSI.AI are installed into `/usr/local/bin`.

  In `system mode` a new dedicated user for the SUSI.AI server process
  is necessary, and will be created. By default it will be named
  `_susiserver`.


### Command line options for `install.sh`

The behaviour of the installation script can be changed with the following
command line options:

- `--system`: enable `system mode` installation, the default is
  `user mode` installation
- `--destdir DIR`: (only in `user mode`) determines the installation
  location in `user mode`. This is the *full* path, not relative to the
  home directory of the user.
- `--prefix DIR`: (only in `system mode`) determines the directory into
  which the `SUSI.AI` directory will be put.
- `--susi-server-user STRING`: (only in `system mode`) specifies the name
  of the dedicated user for the SUSI.AI server user. Will be created if
  not existing already.


## SUSI.AI Smart Speaker

During installation of the SUSI.AI Smart Speaker, further tasks are
performed, and the behaviour cannot be changed using command line options.
